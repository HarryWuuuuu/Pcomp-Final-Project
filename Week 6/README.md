## Theoretical Research
### Professor Phoenix's book
***``It is less clear that the shape of the hand has shaped how our brains work, but it is now generally accepted by cognitive scientists that the evolution of hand control, specifically the “coming together of visual, tactile and proprioceptive feedback on the same action system... may be regarded as the crossing of a biological Rubicon.``***

This makes me reflect on how I perceive the world. In every experience, my feelings are fed back to me through sensory. What I saw, heard, smelled, tasted, and touched all seemed to be transmitted to my brain as information, making me feel it. For example, I didn't know how hard the French stick is before. When I went to the supermarket and squeezed it with my hand, my brain had a concept of the hardness of the French stick. This seems like a `mapping` relationship.

***``Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception is generally considered the foundational text on embodied cognition—the philosophy that our bodies, and even our environment can enact knowledge.``***

Is this a unity of nature and human to some extent?

### Phenomenology of Perception
***``I can, with my left hand, feel my right hand as it touches an object, the right hand as an object is not the right hand as it touches: the first is a system of bones, muscles, and flesh brought down at a point of space, the second shoots through space like a rocket to reveal the external object in its place. In so far as it sees or touches the world, my body can therefore be neither seen nor touched.``***

If we wear gloves or use robotic arms to perform certain behaviors, such as carrying boxes, then in this process, is the hand still one of the ways we perceive the world? Or is it that gloves or robotic arms are one of the ways we perceive the world?
