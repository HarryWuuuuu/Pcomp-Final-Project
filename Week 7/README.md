* **Artist:** Mohammad Farzadnia
* **Introduction:**  
Hive has a single-button, fully automatic core system. It tessellates any type of geometry into hexagons and exports fabrication, assembly data and cost estimation to the user at the push of a button. Its program can be used by anyone to turn their own concepts into reality, with or without prior knowledge about coding, mechanical systems, and electrical wirings. This is inspired by the intrinsic attitudes of bees – a bottom-up, emergent order organises the hive building.

* **Artists:** Xuhao Yuan, Peng Luo, Shuyue Ren
* **Introduction:**  
Hubbub is a user-modulated soundscape interface that synthesises simulated ambient sounds of a restaurant environment to generate a critique on the sounds and experiences we have lost through social distancing.  
Hubbub is a project that situates itself in the contradiction between both hating and missing the noises and distractions of our lost spaces. The project creates a simulated environment, an augmented soundscape in the form of a playful user-modulated interface. By using interactive tableware, users can modulate a generative soundscape and create different atmospheres. The participants can also cooperate to generate a novel and personal soundscape, or even a performance.  
The work gives agency to sound and celebrates the chaos of social gatherings. The user becomes a gourmet, a composer, and a designer of situated sonic atmospheres and experiences.

### Inhibition

* **Artists:** Marina Eleni Mersiadou, Zoe Diakaki
* **Introduction:**  
**Scene I Confinement: The Island**  
The VR participant is inside the mirrored cube, exploring and affecting the VR environment with her biofeedback. The observers explore the space projected on two screens.  
**Scene II Alienation: Mysterious Visitors**  
Visualisation of the observer’s heartbeat and movements in space, captured by a `RealSense camera` and a `heartbeat sensor`.
**Scene III Sun and Moon: Consciousness**  
In the last scene, the mirrored cube becomes transparent, revealing the VR user to the observers.

### MetaSensorium

![MetaSensorium1](https://github.com/HarryWuuuuu/Pcomp-Final-Project/blob/75217b342997d8ec54a66c1522238c61f9e48bfb/Week%207/MetaSensorium1.png)
![MetaSensorium2](https://github.com/HarryWuuuuu/Pcomp-Final-Project/blob/75217b342997d8ec54a66c1522238c61f9e48bfb/Week%207/MetaSensorium2.png)
* **Artists:** Abel Enklaar, Amy Marccelle Johnson
* **Introduction:**  
‘Looking at the screens in front of us, we wondered how our gazes, extrapolated, were crossing each other at a distance, marking a place somewhere in the world that we were both looking at in that moment. The knowledge that this place existed, and we were together marking it, gave us a tangible sense of connection and respite from our feeling of isolation.’ Amy Johnson and Abel Enklaar.  
MetaSensorium responds to the social isolation pervasive to the COVID-19 pandemic by speculating whether wearable technology might allow new levels of connection at a distance. Emerging from own experiences of physical separation and disconnection, MetaSensorium explores the question of how a physical and sensorial connection can be constructed through virtual means. The resulting accessory is activated when two wearers face one another at a distance, which triggers their devices to deliver a sense of the other’s presence as a spectral embrace.

## My Thinking
In the Metaverse in the VR environment, how will hands shape people's cognition? If in the future we can enter the complete virtual reality like the Matrix or Ready Player One, how will our body generate a "philosophy of knowledge"?
