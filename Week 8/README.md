## Circuit Arrangement
I drew some sketches to arrange the wiring on the gloves.

## Solderling

## Assemble the Sensor
Every time a sensor is installed, a code test is carried out to ensure that there are no errors in circuit welding and wiring.

## Reflection
* Such a cable seems to be difficult to wear, and it is necessary to reconsider the installation of the sensor and the layout of the wiring.
* The parameter change range of the pressure sensor needs to be tested again after the assembly is completed.
